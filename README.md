## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee attrition across different departments. The primary goal is to identify key trends, patterns, and factors contributing to attrition, helping HR teams and management make informed, data-driven decisions.

The process involved:

- Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query to prepare raw HR data.
- Feature Engineering with DAX measures for attrition rate, average salary, average tenure, and other KPIs.
- Interactive Dashboard Design with filters and slicers for department, gender, age group, job role, and salary ranges.
- Visualization of Attrition Trends across education, job role, salary bands, age groups, and years at the company.
- By leveraging Power BI’s visualization and calculation capabilities, the project delivers an insightful and interactive tool for understanding workforce dynamics.

## 📂 Repository Contents  

- **HR_Analytics.csv** → Raw HR dataset containing employee details (age, department, salary, attrition, etc.).  
- **HR_Analytics.pbix** → Power BI dashboard file with all visuals, measures, and insights.  
- **README.md** → Project documentation with description, methodology, and outputs.  

---
## 📌 Project Output

The final deliverable is a Power BI Dashboard that provides clear, actionable insights into attrition patterns:

- Overall Workforce Metrics
- Total Employees, Total Attrition, Attrition Rate (%)
- Average Age, Average Salary, and Average Tenure
- Attrition Analysis by Categories
- Department: HR, Research & Development, and Sales dashboards for deep-dives
- Demographics: Age group, gender, education background
- Job Factors: Job role, salary slabs, years at company, years in current role
---
## 🔑 Key Business Insights

- Highest attrition observed among employees aged 26–35 years
- Employees with lower salary slabs (≤ 5k) contribute most to attrition
- Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians show the highest job-role attrition
- Attrition peaks within the first 2 years of employment
- Sales department shows a significantly higher attrition rate (20%+) compared to HR and R&D
---
## 📌 Recommendations  
- Focus retention strategies on the **26–35 age group** and employees in their **first 2 years**.  
- Revisit pay structure for employees earning **≤ 5k**; add performance incentives.  
- Address attrition among **Sales Executives** and **Laboratory Technicians** with role-specific programs.  
- Prioritize **Sales department**, where attrition is **20%+**, via exit interviews and HR initiatives.  
- Improve **work-life balance** by reducing overtime and offering flexible schedules.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations  
- Built on a **static CSV file**; no live data refresh.  
- Dataset excludes factors like **culture, leadership, and well-being**.  
- Dashboard is **descriptive only**; lacks predictive modeling for attrition forecasting.  
- Focused on **HR, R&D, and Sales** departments, not full organizational scope.  
- External influences (market trends, economy) are not reflected.  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  

- **Add More Departments** → Expand dashboards beyond HR, R&D, and Sales for a company-wide view.  
- **Automated Data Refresh** → Connect Power BI to a database or cloud source for scheduled updates instead of manual CSV loading.  
- **New KPIs** → Introduce metrics such as promotion rate, absenteeism, and training hours to enrich analysis.  
- **Improved Visuals** → Use advanced charts (heatmaps, funnels) for clearer interpretation of attrition drivers.  
- **Drill-Down Analysis** → Enable interactive drill-through to explore job role, education, or salary-specific details.  
- **Basic Forecasting** → Apply Power BI’s built-in forecasting to estimate future attrition trends.
